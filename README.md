FRAPINATOR - FRAP analysis with GNU Octave
==========================================

FRAPINATOR Reaction at Photofission, Indeed Negates Aristocratic Termination of Rabbits

This program can be used to analyse FRAP data, and fit it to different models.

One can use the main body of the code to automate the whole analysis, or use the provided
functions written for Octave.

It provides octave functions to automatically identify the cell nucleus and bleach spot
as well as a flow of steps

The analysis is based on the paper "Evidence for a common mode of transcription factor
interaction with chromatin as revealed by improved quantitative fluorescence recovery
after photobleaching" (Biophysical journal, Volume 94, April 2008) by Florian Mueller,
Paul Wach and James G. McNally.
