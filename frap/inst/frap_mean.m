## @deftypefn {Function File} {} frap_mean (@var{img}, @var{ind})
## Compute average for the last dimension.
##
## This is function is used to compute the mean intensity of a region over
## time, based on the indices for the first timepoint.  It broadcasts the
## indices over the other dimensions.
##
## @var{img} can have any number of dimensions.  The last dimension is
## assumed to be time.
##
## @var{ind} are linear indices for region of interest 
##
## The output is a vector with length equal to the @var{img} last dimension.
## Its first element is equal @code{mean (@var{img}(@var{ind}))}
