## usage: [rCon, sigma, theta, fInt, stdrsd, Z, q] = fitter_radial_profile (dis, Int, skip, res)
##
## Fits bleach spot radial intensity data (Int) along the distance (dis),
## skipping the first (skip) radial points. The resolution of the image (res)
## is taken as argument and used as initial guess value of sigma for the fitting.
##
## The function used for fitting has 3 parameters that describe the radial profile. 'rCon' is
## the width of the constant part in the center of the bleach spot that has no recovery. The
## recovery part is described by a gaussian distribution with variance 'sigma'. 'Theta' is the
## depth of the bleaching, i.e. the ammount of intensity left at the center of the bleach spot
## after the bleaching.

## Output are the fitted three parameters (rCon, sigma, theta) to the function
## func_radial_profile, the intensity values (fInt) in that function and standardized
## residuals (stdrsd). The direct numeric integration of measured data (Z) and the
## integration of estimated profile (q) are also given to allow for comparison.
##
##
## Direct numeric integration (Z) uses the profile given (Int) to calculate
## the area under that data.
## Integration of the estimated profile (q) is to use the function with the fitted
## parameters, and calculate the area under that function given a specific interval.
## If the fitting worked well, these two values should be similar since they are 
## calculating the same thing, one using the 'raw values', and the other using the
## function with parameters fitted with those 'raw values'.
##
##
## Input ==>
##		dis		= distances of the intensities (vector)
##		Int		= normalized intensity values for intervals of 1 pixel (vector)
##		skip	= number of first points to skip when fitting (scalar)
##		res		= resolution of the image (scalar)
##
## Output ==>
##		rCon	= fitted parameter (scalar)
##		sigma	= fitted parameter (scalar)
##		theta	= fitted parameter (scalar)
##		fInt	= intensity values with the fitted parameters for intervals of 1 pixel (vector)
##		stdrsd	= standardized residuals (check help leasqr)
##		Z		= direct numeric integration of intensity values Int (scalar)
##		q		= integration of estimated profile (scalar)
##
## Important notes:
##		'Int' must be normalized from '0' (total bleach), to '1' (unbleached).
