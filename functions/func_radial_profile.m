## usage: [y] = fitter_radial_profile (distances, parameters)
##
## This function describes the radial intensity profile of a spot in
## 3 pieces. A first part with constant intensity (center of bleach
## spot), a second part (degradee from the center of spot to its
## edge) and a third part (unbleached after the edge of the spot).
##
## It has 3 parameters that describe the radial profile. 'rCon' is the
## width of the constant part in the center of the bleach spot that
## has no recovery. The recovery part is described by a gaussian
## distribution with variance 'sigma'. 'Theta' is the depth of the
## bleaching, i.e. the ammount of intensity left at the center of the
## bleach spot after the bleaching

  # routines such as leasqr
  # Plus, if this is not set in advance, then the loop that will assign its values
  # will place them in one row while the values of y that they will be compared with
  # by fitting routines are in a collumn. This would also confound them.

  # These values make no physical sense since there's no negative
  # distances and intensity values are normalized between '0' and '1'
  # It 'returns' instead of 'error' so that if fitting routine (such
  # as leasqr or linfit) attempts to fit with such values it will skip
  # them and try other values.
